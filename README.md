# Snake-Game
This is my implementation of the snake game.
Using Java's method reference, swing package, and linked list, the game was made.
<br><br>
**The Menu Panel**<br>
Right after running the jar file, a menu panel should appear with a play and exit button; a similar menu panel should also appear when the game is over.
<br><br>
play - Press the play button to start playing the game. The panel will switch to the game and begin immediately.<br>
exit - The button stops the program from executing when pressed.
<br><br>
**Rules and Controls**<br>
The rules of my implementation are the same as the norm. The game will be over once the snake's head goes out of bounds or crashes itself, and it will grow in size when it eats the apple; eating the apple will not affect the snake's speed. If an apple is not seen, the snake's body must be covering it; move around for a while, and it should appear.
<br><br>
The snake's direction can be controlled using the keyboard's up, down, left, and right buttons; the left button changes the snake's direction to the left, the right makes it go right, and so on.
Additionally, you can press the space bar to stop executing the program while in the middle of the game. I initially added this functionality for debugging purposes but decided to leave it there.
